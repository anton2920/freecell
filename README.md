# FreeCell
## FreeCell is a clone of the famous Microsoft Windows game

## Brief description
FreeCell is a card game written on the C++ programming language. Graphics performed using SFML. I've tried to make the exact copy, but still much work has to be done. 

## Installation guide
``` bash
sh ./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```
After that, run `ldconfig(8)`. Do `sudo ldconfig`, there's no harm in it.
